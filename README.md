# Belly Button Biodiversity Analysis

## Overview of Project

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Purpose

The purpose of my project was to finish Roza's dashboard. I was able take the bacterial data from volunteers and visually show the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons.
